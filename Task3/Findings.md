# OSINT Investigation Simulation

This project simulates an OSINT investigation of a suspicious phone number using various techniques and tools. The following steps showcase the process of gathering information and uncovering the truth behind the number **+1-800-555-1234**.

## **Investigation Story**

The investigation began when a suspicious phone number, **+1-800-555-1234**, started surfacing in customer complaints. The number was associated with a customer service line, but an anonymous tip suggested something more sinister was afoot. To start, the investigators ran a **Google search** for the phone number, revealing that it belonged to **XYZ Company’s customer service**. While this seemed harmless at first, they didn’t stop there.

The next step was a **reverse phone lookup**. By using a service to trace the phone number, the team found that it was registered with **Verizon**, a major telecom provider, and located in **New York, NY**. Still, something felt off. The phone number seemed too generic for a legitimate customer service line, especially for a big corporation.

Turning to **social media**, the investigators searched the number across platforms, finally locating an account linked to **John Doe**, the business account for **XYZ Enterprises** on **Facebook**. The account, though official in appearance, showed signs of manipulation, such as the absence of customer reviews and oddly timed posts.

The team then moved to **metadata analysis**, where they extracted data from an image associated with the business account. The image’s metadata revealed that it was taken with a **Canon EOS 5D Mark IV** camera on **2024-01-09**. This raised more questions than it answered. Why was the company posting an image with such specific metadata, and could it be related to the fraudulent activity?

Finally, the team checked **800Notes** to see if the number had been flagged for scams. To their dismay, the number had been reported multiple times for fraudulent activity. Victims shared stories of being misled by a company impersonating **XYZ Enterprises** in an attempt to steal personal information.

After piecing together the information from these different sources, the investigation was clear: **+1-800-555-1234** wasn’t a legitimate customer service number but part of a **scam operation**. By combining **search engines**, **reverse lookups**, **social media searches**, **metadata analysis**, and **scam reports**, the team uncovered the truth.
